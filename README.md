# PicewiseLinear
The two functions inside the R code are designed to produce two types of analysis. First, to consider the cumulative number of events of a certain type (for example, the number of protests in some city). Then, based on the assumption of a time-varying rate, to detect the fluctuations of the expected number of daily events.

The outputs are:
A time series with the time-varying rate of events
An estimate of the number of shocks
Identification of the significant shocks, where the rate changes more than 20% in less than one month.
